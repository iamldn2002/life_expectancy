# Global Life Expectancy Trends: A Multivariate Analysis of Influential Indicators

## Overview
This repository is created by Dingning Li, contains research and analysis exploring the various determinants of life expectancy globally. The project employs a multivariate approach to assess how different socioeconomic, educational, and health-related factors interact to affect longevity. The data is obtained from World Health Organization.
